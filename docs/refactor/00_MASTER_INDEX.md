# 00 — Master Index: LEXA DERMS V1.0 Refactor Program

*Generated 2026-07-04 from `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.MD`. This directory is the
engineering playbook for delivering Version 1.0. Start here.*

## The documents

| Doc | What it is | Update cadence |
|---|---|---|
| `00_MASTER_INDEX.md` | This file: map + program status | Every phase boundary |
| `01_IMPLEMENTATION_GAMEPLAN.md` | Vision, philosophy, priorities, milestones, timeline, definition of done | Rarely (structural changes only) |
| `02_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` | Living decision log (AD-001…) incl. open questions | Whenever a decision is made/superseded |
| `03_REFACTOR_PHASES.md` | Phases P0–P6: purpose, risks, rollback, exit criteria | Phase boundaries |
| `04_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` | **Task inventory (single source of truth)**, blocking graph, critical path, review-item traceability | When tasks are added/split |
| `05_ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md` | Standards that prevent W1–W7 recurring | Rarely |
| `06_TESTING_STRATEGY.md` | Every test layer, gates, missing coverage | Phase boundaries |
| `07_QA_GAP_PLAN.md` | Review §9 blind spots → prioritized work | As gaps close |
| `08_RISK_REGISTER.md` | Risks, mitigation, detection, recovery | Phase boundaries + incidents |
| `09_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` | V1.0 ship gate (executed as TASK-081) | As boxes close |
| `10_BACKLOG.md` | Valuable, non-critical-path work | Phase boundaries |
| `tasks/TASK-001…082.md` | Self-contained implementation tasks (hand one to a coding model verbatim) | Task completion → status header |
| `tasks/TASK_TEMPLATE.md` | Canonical task structure | Rarely |

## Reading order

1. **New to the program:** 01 → 03 → 05 → this status table.
2. **Picking up work:** status table below → 04 (is it unblocked?) → the
   task file → its "Files to read" list.
3. **Making a design call:** 02 (has it been decided?) → add/extend an AD.
4. **Before merging anything in the radioactive zone** (05 §12): 06 gates.
5. **Cutting a release:** 09.

Background (read once): `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.MD` (repo root),
`lexa-hub/docs/ADR-0001-distributed-vs-monolith.md`, `docs/BENCH.md`,
`docs/QA_GAPS_20260701.md`, both repos' `CLAUDE.md`.

## How the documents relate

`ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.MD` findings → traceability matrix (04 §5) → phases
(03) → tasks (04 §1, `tasks/`). Decisions the tasks depend on live in 02;
the behavior they must not break lives in 05/06 and each task's
"Things that must NOT change"; the risks they carry live in 08; the finish
line is 09. 07 is the QA-specific slice of the same pipeline.

## Program status

*Update this table as work lands. "Campaign" = full Mayhem run reference.*

| Phase | Tasks | Status | Exit campaign | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 Foundations | 001–018 | IN PROGRESS | — | Done: 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 010, 011, 016, 017 (2026-07-04; details in task headers). Partial: 007 (code merged; bench deploy+wedge test+48h soak at P0 exit). Open: branch protection (human, AD-012); TASK-004's `lockstep` job similarly can't be marked "required" without GitHub auth (same blocker as AD-012) and its LEXA_HUB_RO_TOKEN PAT must be created by a human; 006 worklist = 2 reachable vulns (VULN_BASELINE_2026-07-04.md). |
| P1 Shared modules (R2) | 019–024, 082 | NOT STARTED | — | |
| P2 Device Reconciler (R1) | 025–033 | NOT STARTED | — | Critical path |
| P3 Time & persistence | 034–043 | NOT STARTED | — | |
| P4 Observability & QA depth | 044–055 | NOT STARTED | — | Parallel track |
| P5 Optimizer split (R4) | 056–067 | NOT STARTED | — | Critical path |
| P6 Commercialization | 068–081 | NOT STARTED | — | Order hardware during P2 |

**Milestones:** M0 = P0 exit · M1 = P1 · M2 = P2 · M3 = P3+P4 · M4 = P5 ·
M5 = V1.0 (see 01 §9).

**QA baseline to defend:** V6 campaign, 0.6 FAIL/cycle, 0 BLIND
(2026-07-03); accepted DEGRADEDs per `docs/QA_REPORT_V5_20260703.md` + V6
notes. Next scheduled: V7 10-cycle (expected ~0 FAIL) — becomes the M0
FAST baseline if clean.

## Working agreements (short form)

- Task files are written to be handed to a smaller coding model verbatim;
  if one needed extra context to succeed, fix the task file afterward.
- In task files, **symbol names are authoritative; line numbers are hints**
  — the tree moves under a months-long program, so re-verify any `file:line`
  by grep at execution time before editing.
- Full Mayhem campaign before merging radioactive-zone changes; bench must
  be FAST (`bash scripts/bench-up.sh --fast`); STOCK campaigns at release
  gates.
- Nothing uncommitted overnight. Lockstep changes ship same-session in
  both repos.
- Every completed task updates: its own status header, this status table,
  and any invariant doc it touched.

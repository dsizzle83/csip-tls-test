# Behavior-Preservation Ledger

*Created by TASK-025 (2026-07-05). Governs Phase 2 (Device Reconciler,
TASK-026…033) and the reporting-path changes that ride with it.*

## What this is

The LEXA hub makes "the device match what the hub wants" true through several
**legacy convergence mechanisms** — the optimizer's per-tick restore rule, the
actuator command dedupers + re-assert watchdog + breach reset, `lexa-modbus`'s
reconnect re-assert, and the multi-hop CannotComply chain. **Every one of them
encodes a specific QA scenario** (review W2, RSK-01): each was written to make a
named Mayhem fault-injection scenario pass. Deleting one without knowing which
scenario it protects silently reopens that scenario.

This ledger is the contract that lets AD-002's reconciler (AD-013 schema)
replace that code while **provably preserving behavior**. Each row maps one
legacy mechanism to: the scenario/finding that created it, the behavior that
must survive the replacement, what replaces it, and the Mayhem scenarios that
gate the swap.

## The rule (05 §11)

**No row's mechanism may be deleted until its gate scenarios pass — green — on
the replacement.** Behavior survives even when code does not. A reconciler task
that removes a mechanism whose gate scenarios have not been re-run (or that
regress) is not done, regardless of unit-test status.

## How this file is maintained

- **TASK-027…033 update the `Status` column** as they land: `legacy-active` →
  `shadow` (reconciler observing, legacy still authoritative) → `replaced`
  (legacy deleted, gates green) — or `keep` / `keep-until-P5` rows stay as-is.
- File:line citations are @HEAD as of the date in the header row; a task that
  finds them drifted re-verifies and corrects them in the same PR (the tree
  moves — this table was itself re-verified against HEAD on 2026-07-05, and 8 of
  11 rows' line numbers had drifted from the TASK-025 draft).
- Gate-scenario names must exist in the Mayhem catalog (`cmd/dashboard/mayhem.go`,
  `mayhem_world.go`, `mqtt_scenarios.go`; `scripts/mayhem.py --list`).

## Notes on re-verification (2026-07-05)

Line numbers drifted from the TASK-025 draft (the tree moved through P0/P1).
Corrected rows: **L2** (per-actuator fields 144→147), **L3** (`main.go`
99–118 → 104–107, 130–134), **L4** (module region 314–412 → 336–433;
desired-while-disconnected 396–406 → 421–427; stale-ceiling clear 385–394 →
411–414), **L5** (`main.go` 98 → 103, 230–257 → 253–281; `model.go` 315–320 →
311–319), **L6** (203–213 → 221–231, 666–710 → 707–754), **L9** (261–278 →
283–300), **L10** (checkBatterySafety end 1648 → 1641), **L11** (258–314 →
294–350, 349–368 → 393–416). Unchanged and re-confirmed: **L1, L7, L8**. All 18
distinct gate-scenario names were confirmed present in the Mayhem catalog.

## Shadow observations (TASK-027, 2026-07-05)

Code landed (lexa-hub `task/027-battery-shadow`): the hub-side battery
desired-doc publisher (`cmd/hub/desired.go`, additive — legacy actuator
delegated to first, unchanged) and the lexa-modbus shadow shell
(`cmd/modbus/reconcile_shadow.go`) driving one `internal/reconcile.Reconciler`
per battery device off the retained doc, poll readbacks, and observed legacy
writes, logging `reconciler[shadow] ...` verdict lines — a recorder only, no
write path. **Status column for L1–L4 intentionally left at `legacy-active`**:
this session was code + unit tests only (no bench deploy); the bench soak,
verdict/campaign evidence, and the `shadow` status flip are the wave-gate
follow-up the task names, not yet done.

Two things to carry into that soak, found while wiring the first real
consumer against lexa-modbus's actual (partial) measurement capability:

- **Reconnect-on-drop (L4) is deliberately not fed to the shadow.** The
  task's shadow-feed list is desired docs + poll readbacks + observed legacy
  writes only; `reconcile.Reconciler.Reconnected` is never called from
  `reconcile_shadow.go`. A battery that drops mid-poll never reaches
  `Observe` at all (its poll-error update is skipped upstream before the
  shadow is invoked), so the shadow's assessment simply holds through the
  outage and resumes at the next successful poll. Legacy's
  `retryDevice.lastCtrl` reassert-on-reconnect is unconditional and immediate;
  the shadow's write-on-diff (were it live) would only fire on the next poll
  that observes a mismatch. Watch `battery-reboot` specifically for a
  reconciler-vs-legacy timing gap in the divergence log — expected to be a
  documented semantic difference (reconciler slower by up to one poll
  interval), not a bug, but it needs a real disposition from the soak, not an
  assumption from this desk.
- **A battery doc expressing both `SetpointW` and `Connect` (the common real
  shape — e.g. the reserve-idle tick reconnects and idles every cycle) can
  never be judged "converged" by the shadow**, because lexa-modbus has no
  register to read Connect state back from. `internal/reconcile`'s
  completeness gate correctly holds forever in that case (verified
  deterministic — see the `reconcile.go` fix below), which the shadow reports
  as a permanent, silent hold rather than a match or a divergence. This is
  expected and by design (ledger L9's discipline: an unassessable sample
  proves nothing), but it means the shadow's `match` rate during the soak
  will be lower than "the reconciler agrees with legacy" — most battery
  decision points will simply never resolve to a verdict at all until a
  Connect readback exists. Worth a line in the TASK-028 write-up so nobody
  reads a quiet `matches` counter as "everything converged."

### Wave-gate soak results (2026-07-05, P2 wave gate — L1–L4 flipped to `shadow`)

Deployed with `"reconciler":{"battery":"shadow"}`; soak = targeted battery-family
Mayhem run (`export-cap-full-battery, battery-wrong-sign, battery-soc-refuse,
battery-charge-disabled` → 0P/4D/0F/0B, all DEGRADED `cannot_comply=True`, at
baseline) + the full 51-scenario FAST campaign
(`qa-mayhem-20260705-151009.md`: **34P/17D/0F/0B**, within the 32–35P band and
strictly better than the pre-gate 32P/19D baseline — `export-cap-full-battery`
and `solar-reboot-forget` flipped D→P, both known boundary-flaky).

- **Blocking bug found + fixed before the soak could mean anything:**
  `systemd/mosquitto-lexa.acl` had no `lexa/desired/` grant, so with the ACL
  live the retained doc never reached the broker and the shadow's early
  `verdict=match` lines were vacuous (`would=none` because `Desired` was
  never set). Fixed (battery-scoped write grant for lexa-hub, read grant for
  lexa-modbus), lexa-hub branch `task/027-desired-topic-acl` commit 1a2d777.
- **Steady-state divergence rate: 0.** `lexa_mb_shadow_divergences_total` = 1
  for the whole session; the single counted divergence was DURING
  battery-charge-disabled fault injection (`diverge:write-on-diff`, readback
  SOC=100%/W=0 against a charge doc — the reconciler noticing, one poll
  faster than legacy's watchdog window, that a commanded charge wasn't
  happening). Disposition: expected semantic difference, informative for
  T028, not a core bug. Zero Observe-driven divergences in clean operation.
- **Predicted Connect-completeness hold confirmed live:** the battery doc
  always carries `connect`, lexa-modbus has no Connect readback, so
  `lexa_mb_shadow_matches_total` froze (206) once the real doc landed — by
  design. The log line's `verdict=match` text prints for any non-write
  decision and is NOT the counted-match signal; use the counters.
- **L4 reconnect-feed caveat stands** (shadow never calls `Reconnected`);
  `battery-reboot` PASSed with no reconciler-vs-legacy divergence surfacing
  (the hold-through-outage behavior masks the timing gap in shadow).
  T028 must wire `Reconnected` before the flip.
- **AD-013 edge machinery all exercised on real faults:** `StaleDesired` ×3
  (doc aged past staleness while faults froze commanding), `RejectedDoc
  reject=SeqRegression` ×1 (mqtt-broker-restart redelivering an older
  retained doc — correctly rejected), `SeqReset` ×1 (hub-restart-mid-cap:
  seq back to 0 with newer issued_at — accepted, reported). would_writes
  ended at 119 (dominated by benign `new-desired` adoptions under command
  churn) — the write-storm gauge for T028 looks unalarming.

**Incidental fix, filed here for traceability:** `internal/reconcile.matches()`
(TASK-026, merged) had an order-dependent bug — a doc expressing two fields
where only one is ever supplied by the readback could non-deterministically
report `complete=true` or `complete=false` depending on Go's randomized map
iteration order, contradicting the package's own "hold on incomplete, never
write-storm" guarantee. Fixed in the same lexa-hub commit as this task (two-pass
check: completeness for every key first, then tolerance), with a new
regression test (`TestPartialReadbackIsCompleteDeterministic`). This is exactly
the L1–L4/Connect situation above — the bug would otherwise have made the
shadow's verdict flicker between `match`/`diverge` on identical inputs.

## TASK-028 — battery flip to `reconciler-active` (2026-07-05)

L1–L4 **battery-scope** rows flipped `shadow → reconciler-active`: the
`internal/reconcile` core now owns battery hardware writes via the mode-selected
shell (`cmd/modbus/reconcile_shell.go`, lexa-hub branch `task/028-battery-flip`
f7dcef4), driving the SAME `battCommandToControl` + `registry.ApplyControlTo`
path legacy used. **Nothing deleted** — the legacy battery command topic keeps
publishing and being subscribed (ignored on hardware when active; belt and
braces for instant rollback, that is TASK-032's job). Solar/EVSE L1–L4 stay
legacy-active (T029/030).

- **L4 `Reconnected` wired** (the shadow deliberately never fed it): retryDevice
  sets an atomic reconnect flag on reopen; the shell consumes it and reasserts
  the standing desired before the post-reconnect readback is trusted. Verified
  live (batsim drop → `applied … (reason=reconnect-reassert)` next poll) and
  `battery-reboot` PASS. retryDevice's own `lastCtrl` reassert is suppressed for
  the active battery so there is exactly ONE reasserter (no double-write race);
  solar keeps `lastCtrl`.

- **L8 interlock stays `keep` and SENIOR to the reconciler** (AD-002 answer
  confirmed in practice): a read-only `isTripped` accessor was added (no logic
  change; `interlock_test.go` unedited). While Tier-0 has a pack
  force-disconnected, the reconciler **suppresses connect-restoring writes**
  (reports `InterlockHold`) instead of rewriting `Conn=1` — the guard-vs-guard
  oscillation the program exists to kill. Gate evidence: `battery-wrong-sign`
  **PASS**, INV-SOC/INV-EXPORT/SAFETY held, **no INV-HUNT/oscillation**. The
  interlock's charge intent is now fed from the desired doc the reconciler
  executes (moved off the legacy subscribe path).

**Gate results** (`docs/qa-task028/`): targeted battery set 3P/4D/0F/0B (each
PASS or accepted-DEGRADED `cannot_comply=True`); full 51-scenario FAST campaign
**33P/18D/0F/0B**, within the 34P/17D band (sole P→D drift = the task-pinned
accepted-DEGRADED `export-cap-full-battery`). SAFETY held everywhere. Bench left
FAST + battery-active. Rollback rehearsed (config `shadow` + restart).

## TASK-029/030 — solar + EVSE flip to `reconciler-active` (2026-07-05)

L1–L4 **solar-scope** and **L7** flipped `legacy-active → reconciler-active
(solar)`; **L11** noted **preserved-by-reuse (evse)**; L2 EVSE scope →
`reconciler-active (evse)`. lexa-hub branch `task/029-030-solar-evse-flip`
(2cbd894). **Nothing deleted** — legacy solar/EVSE command topics keep publishing
and being subscribed, ignored on hardware when active (belt and braces; TASK-032
deletes). ACL extended: hub write + modbus read `lexa/desired/solar/+`, hub write
+ ocpp read `lexa/desired/evse/+` (installed on the Pi + mosquitto reloaded;
delivery verified by subscription, not publish success).

- **L1/L7 (solar restore is an explicit write).** The hub's
  `desiredPublishingSolarActuator` maps `SolarCommand.CurtailToW` NaN→
  `CeilingW=RestoreCeilingW` (never absent); the `solarShell` reconciler writes
  that ceiling on the cap→clear edge, reproducing `restoreOnGenLimitClear`. The
  retained, connectivity-independent doc keeps the cap value while the inverter
  is dark and the reconciler reasserts on reconnect — so the `solarCapActive`
  dark-inverter gate needs **no publisher equivalent**. Divergence is **one-sided**
  (over-ceiling only); an inverter under its ceiling at dusk is compliant.
- **L4 (solar).** `reassertLocked`'s inverter branch is suppressed for an active
  inverter (`reconciledActive`); the shell's `Reconnected()` reassert plus a
  restore-ceiling **initial-desired seed** (never-commanded case; seed's startup
  write dropped — reassertLocked fires on reconnect, not startup) is the SINGLE
  reasserter. No double-write.
- **L11 (EVSE) preserved by reuse.** `applyCommand`'s body was refactored into
  `bridge.Apply(stationID, evseID, limitA)` used byte-identically by the legacy
  path AND the `evseShell`; rejected-profile-as-error and `implausibleCurrent`
  gating are unchanged (`meter_validate_test.go` green unmodified). Convergence is
  judged **one-sided from metered current only** — profile-Accepted is a write
  success, never convergence. The reconciler adds the reassert-on-reconnect the
  legacy path lacked (via `SetNewChargingStationHandler`); backoff starts at 15 s
  (≥ the 10 s per-call bound, no overlapping calls).

**Shadow triage (pre-flip, live):** solar shadow ran clean — 90 under-ceiling
one-sided `verdict=match`, 13 `diverge:new-desired` all with `would==legacy` on
each ceiling change (incl. the `CeilingW=1e9` restore edge), 1 `SeqReset` (hub
restart, AD-013 rule 2), **0 stale-ceiling holds**. EVSE shadow idle until an
EV session commands current (expected).

**Post-flip gate evidence:** the two release-edge **oracles** PASS solo —
`release-while-rebooting` (solar recovered to full 47 s after the device
returned) and `curtailment-release` (recovered 24 s after return). Targeted
15-scenario solar+EV set **6P/9D/0F/0B** — all DEGRADED are the refuse/reject/
lag/reboot families where the hub correctly flags CannotComply (accepted), and
every *correctness* scenario PASSes: `ev-meter-freeze` (silence≠convergence: held
+ flagged stale, cap kept), `ev-wrong-units` (implausible rejected, L11),
`ev-connector-flap` (stable, no over-command), `solar-bad-scale` (plausibleW
withheld). No INV-HUNT (active applies are backoff-paced, ≤3 identical writes to
converge a slow/refusing inverter, not a tight loop). **Full 51-scenario FAST
campaign 33P/18D/0F/0B** (`qa-mayhem-20260705-205515.md`) — EXACTLY the TASK-028
battery-active baseline, i.e. the solar+EVSE flip added **zero regressions**
(0 FAIL, 0 BLIND, SAFETY held). `solar-reboot-forget`'s DEGRADED is the known
028-baseline D. The ×10-solo per scenario and the 10-cycle campaign soak remain
as deeper Principal-gated validation. Bench left FAST + battery/solar/evse-active.
Rollback = config `shadow` + restart (rehearsed on the shadow→active transition).

# 02 — Architecture Decisions (living document)

*Append-only in spirit: decisions get superseded, not erased. Each entry:
Problem / Decision / Alternatives / Tradeoffs / Migration / Open questions.
ADR-0001 lives in `lexa-hub/docs/` and is incorporated by reference.
New decisions made during the refactor are added here (AD-00X) and, when
they affect the product repo, mirrored as `lexa-hub/docs/ADR-000N`.*

## AD-001 ✅ Keep the distributed six-service topology (= ADR-0001)

Incorporated by reference: `lexa-hub/docs/ADR-0001-distributed-vs-monolith.md`.
The review's grade (A−) confirms it. Nothing in this roadmap adds or removes
a process; the two-loop hierarchy (Tier 0/1/2) is preserved through every
phase. **Never revisit without new latency-budget measurements.**

## AD-002 ✅ Convergence: one Device Reconciler, declarative desired state (R1)

**Problem.** Four uncoordinated mechanisms (restore re-command, cmdDeduper+
watchdog+breach-reset, retryDevice.lastCtrl, five-hop CannotComply chain)
solve "device must reach hub's desired state"; guard×guard interactions are
the dominant defect class (review W2).

**Decision.** Optimizer publishes a retained, versioned, per-device
desired-state document; a reconciler co-located with the hardware driver
(`lexa-modbus`, `lexa-ocpp`) owns write-on-diff, verify-by-readback,
reassert-on-reconnect, escalating retry, and non-convergence reporting.

**Alternatives considered.**
- *Keep hardening the four layers* — rejected: each fix multiplies the
  interaction surface (empirically proven, 2026-07-03 dedupe/breach bug).
- *Reconciler inside lexa-hub* — rejected: reassert-on-reconnect must
  survive hub death and broker restarts; the ADR-0001 tiering puts local
  reflexes next to hardware.
- *Non-retained command stream with acks* — rejected: retained desired
  state gives free crash recovery (the pattern already proven by
  `lexa/csip/control`).

**Tradeoffs.** Retained desired state inherits the stale-retained-message
risk (§8.3) → mitigated by mandatory `issuedAt`/`seq` + staleness policy
(TASK-025/042). Reconciler adds a state machine per device — but it
*replaces* four.

**Migration.** Shadow (observe/compare, no writes) → flip per device class
(battery → solar → EVSE) → collapse CannotComply chain → delete legacy.
Behavior-preservation ledger in TASK-025 maps every deleted guard to the
Mayhem scenario that created it.

**Open questions.** ❓ Does the Tier-0 interlock read the desired-state doc
directly (bypassing hub) for its reflexes, or stay measurement-only?
Default: measurement-only (unchanged) until P5. ❓ Meter gets no desired
state (read-only device) — confirm no code path assumes otherwise.

## AD-003 ✅ Shared protocol code: one module, versioned, CI-pinned (R2)

**Decision.** Extract `sunspec` (+derbase layouts), `ocppserver`, and the
2030.5 model into a shared module (working name `lexa-proto`), developed
via `go.work`, consumed by both repos at a pinned version; CI fails on
version skew. Product side is merge authority for today's divergence, but
each diff hunk is reviewed — the sim side may hold real fixes.

**Alternatives.** Mono-repo merge (rejected: product/test-bench release
cadences differ; the review only requires shared *modules*); keep
duplication + better diff CI (rejected: divergence already happened under
a documented rule).

**Open questions.** ❓ One module or three? Start with one module, three
packages — split later only if versioning pressure appears.

## AD-012 ✅ Hosting & CI platform: GitHub (de facto)

**Decision.** Both repos stay on private GitHub under the single-maintainer
account: `dsizzle83/lexa-hub`, `dsizzle83/csip-tls-test` (both remotes
verified live 2026-07-04 via `git ls-remote`, contra an earlier "no remote"
assumption). CI = GitHub Actions with a self-hosted desktop runner for
wolfSSL-cgo jobs (TASK-002/003). Workflow: feature branch → PR → CI green →
merge; lockstep changes (bench ↔ product, e.g. `internal/southbound/sunspec`
audit MTR-4) ship as paired PRs that reference each other (05 §11). TASK-001
is the one intentional exception: it commits/merges directly to `main` in
both repos to land the pre-existing QA-arc fixes and this doc set, then the
PR-only discipline starts. `lexa-proto` (AD-003) gets a repo in the same
account when it's extracted; its version-pin mechanism (go.mod version vs
committed SHA pin) is decided in TASK-019's ADR.

**Alternatives considered.** Self-hosted Gitea on the desktop — rejected for
now: no material benefit over GitHub for a single maintainer, adds an
availability dependency (the desktop is also a bench node), and GitHub
Actions is needed regardless for TASK-002/003's CI. A new GitHub
organization — rejected: no team, no billing/seat reason to split from the
personal account. Revisit either if the air-gap policy ever extends from the
bench network to source hosting.

**Branch protection — 2026-07-04 status: attempted, blocked, unresolved.**
TASK-001 tried to enable "require PR before merging" on `main` in both repos
via `gh api -X PUT repos/dsizzle83/<repo>/branches/main/protection`. Neither
the `gh` CLI nor any GitHub API token/credential (checked: `~/.netrc`, `gh`
config, git credential helpers) was available in the execution environment —
only SSH deploy-key auth for `git push`/`git pull`, which the REST/GraphQL
API does not accept. Confirmed the API needs auth (unauthenticated
`GET /branches/main/protection` → 401). **Branch protection is NOT yet
active on either repo's `main` — this is the one open item TASK-001 could
not close.** A human with a GitHub PAT or the `gh` CLI logged in must run
(or click through Settings → Branches):
```
gh api -X PUT repos/dsizzle83/lexa-hub/branches/main/protection \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -f required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count=0 \
  -F required_status_checks=null -F enforce_admins=false \
  -F restrictions=null -f required_linear_history=false \
  -f allow_force_pushes=false -f allow_deletions=false
```
(and the equivalent for `csip-tls-test`). Enable "require PR before merging"
now; add "require status checks" once TASK-002/003 land CI. Direct-push
lockout applies to the human maintainer too — that's the point. Track
closing this as a fast follow-up before any task after TASK-001 merges its
PR (the workflow this program adopts assumes protection is live).

## AD-004 ✅ Time: single `utilitytime` owner (R3)

**Decision.** One package owns offset acquisition (from `/tm`), smoothing +
step classification, `serverNow`, event-window evaluation, expiry, and the
grace policies (`expiryConfirmTicks`, `csipReportGraceS`, both scheduler
clock-regression guards, default-fallback hold). Consumers: walker,
scheduler, hub state, lexa-api, optimizer TOU.

**Non-negotiable ports (verbatim semantics + tests):** clock-regression
guard both halves; the 2026-07-03 default-fallback guard (hold still-served
unexpired event over a resolved DefaultDERControl); `serverNow = local +
offset` everywhere. Local (SOM) clock steps get an explicit policy
(TASK-037). **Verified 2026-07-04:** hub freshness windows are *already*
monotonic-safe (`time.Now()`+`Sub`); the local-step exposure is confined to
utility-time comparisons (expiry, TOU) — TASK-037 documents receiver-side
arrival stamping as the cross-process freshness mechanism rather than
rewriting freshness code. Accepted behavior change: wall-clock-denominating
`expiryConfirmTicks` (TASK-036) shifts STOCK control-expiry release from
45 s to 30 s (FAST unchanged at 9 s) — deliberate per 05 §5; campaign-gated.

## AD-005 ✅ Persistence: append-only event journal + guard snapshots, not a database (W5)

**Decision.** Newline-delimited, size-rotated, fsync-batched journal on
its own quota (journald-style), recording controls adopted, dispatches,
breach episodes, CannotComply — doubles as the utility-facing audit log.
Separately, a small guard/breach snapshot (JSON, atomic rename) restored on
start behind a flag. Retained MQTT remains the *bus* recovery mechanism;
the journal is the *record*; the snapshot only covers state whose loss
causes protocol noise (duplicate CannotComply begin) or safety regressions.

**Alternatives.** SQLite (rejected for now: flash wear, fsync cost, new
dependency; revisit for fleet telemetry), rely on MQTT retention alone
(rejected: §8.3 rollback risk + no audit record).

## AD-006 🔶 Bus schema: version envelope, reject-and-alarm

**Decision.** Every bus JSON message carries `"v": N`; subscribers reject
unknown majors, alarm via metrics/log, and (for retained control-plane
topics) trigger the re-request path instead of running with zero-values.
Design in TASK-017; the desired-state document (AD-002) is the first
new schema born versioned. Pending validation: rolling-upgrade test.

## AD-007 🔶 Optimizer split: constraint controller over economic layer, plant model (R4)

**Decision.** Priority-ordered constraint controller (safety > compliance >
economics) with one `session` struct per constraint; per-device plant model
(ramp rate, control latency, taper curve — configured now, discovered
later) replaces bench-calibrated globals. Shadow-mode dual-run gates every
flip. Multi-device from the start (breach list, per-device sessions).
Pending validation: shadow-diff results (TASK-059).

**Open questions.** ❓ Plant-model discovery (probe ramps on commissioning)
is P6/backlog — configured-only for V1.0. ❓ DP planner stays as-is below
the constraint layer; revisit only if shadow diffs implicate it.

## AD-008 🔶 Security: broker ACLs now, API token+TLS now, OCPP profile 2 at P6

**Decision.** Per-service Mosquitto credentials + topic ACLs (config
sketch already exists in `mosquitto-lexa.conf`); lexa-api gets bearer-token
auth + TLS (consumers verified 2026-07-04: dashboard proxy/logmux, mayhem +
replay drivers via the dashboard's hub client, metersim linked mode — all
updated in lockstep, TASK-014); OCPP moves to security profile 2 in P6.
**Verified 2026-07-04:** SP2 is *already implemented* on both sides
(`ocppserver` has `ws.NewTLSServer` + constant-time BasicAuth; evsim has
`-tls-ca/-auth-user/-auth-pass`) — TASK-074 is enablement/provisioning
(certs, configs, lockstep deploy, negative-auth test), not development.
Bench admin/simapi surfaces stay open *on the air-gapped bench only* —
documented as a bench property, never a product default. Deployed-vs-repo
mosquitto config differs (the Pi runs a slimmed conf.d drop-in) — ACL work
must edit both (TASK-013).

## AD-009 ❓ HTTP client on the northbound boundary (R5/D9)

**Problem.** Hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 parsing over wolfSSL parses hostile
utility bytes. **Evidence correction (verified 2026-07-04):** the review's
"chunked decoding" claim is wrong — `tlsclient` *rejects* chunked responses
outright, and a 10 MiB body cap (`maxResponseBody`) already exists; the
real gaps are the unbounded **header** read and hand-rolled status/header/
Content-Length parsing, plus the missing chunked support itself if a
utility server ever requires it. **Options:** (a) `net.Conn` shim over the
wolfSSL session under Go's `http.Transport`; (b) fuzz + harden the existing
parser. The correction narrows (b)'s cost but (a) also *closes the chunked
functional gap*; still leaning (a). Decision in TASK-069, informed by
TASK-047 fuzz findings. Until then the parser gets the header cap
(part of TASK-047).

## AD-010 ❓ CSIP curve functions (volt-var / volt-watt)

derbase has write paths; nothing drives them from CSIP. V1.0 must either
implement closed-loop curve dispatch or explicitly de-scope in product
claims + conformance statement. Decision in TASK-080 after utility/market
input. De-scope is acceptable for V1.0; silence is not.

## AD-011 ✅ Crash-only design is intentional

MQTT handlers do not `recover()`; a panic kills the service; systemd
restarts (5 s) + retained topics + (post-P3) snapshot restore re-seed
state. This is the documented intended design (review §10.6) — watchdogs
(TASK-007/008) extend it to live-but-wedged. Do not add blanket recovers.
